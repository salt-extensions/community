## Agenda and notes

- **Welcome any newcomers**

- **Announcements**

- **Meeting items for  discussion.**
    - Had contact with Nick, he is going to reach out to Max about access to PyPI
    - Salt infrastructure changes to packaging.broadcom.com is on-going

- **Discussion of next steps with this working group.**
    - Nick reached out to Max, who suggested group ownership for PyPI access with the ability to add
      contributors to it.
    - Discussed saltext-zabbix with Raymond Kuiper, use of saltext-copier and reaching out to OrangeDog via
      GitHub should work. saltext-copier also has workflow documentation for maintaining saltext-xxxx modules.
    - Discussed module migration with Dafydd, and the core vs community modules and how some older (unused
      modules) could be left behind (for example: boto2), but the code supporting everything is getting
      archived. Also the current great migration has some module files that are in the wrong spot, but these will only really be identifed as implementation of the saltext is created.
    - Mentioned David Murphy will be going on PTO till end of Jan after Christmas break, and Shane Lee from
      the Salt Team will run meeting in David's absence.

## Next steps

- Next meeting is December 19th.
