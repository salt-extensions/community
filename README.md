## Salt Extensions working group

The Salt Extensions working group is the place to go if you would like to help
create, improve, and maintain a Salt extension. We'll collaborate as peers to
help ensure your Salt extensions are well-designed and easy to use. It's a great
opportunity to network while also skilling up on Salt, Python, and module
documentation.

Come talk to the Salt Extensions working group by joining the `#salt-extensions`
channel on the Discord Server [Salt Extensions](https://discord.com/channels/1200072194781368340/1208165123240370197).

The current working group captain is [Shane Lee](https://github.com/twangboy).
